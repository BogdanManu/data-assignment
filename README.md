# data-assignment
Join datasets into a new dataset

Thinking logic 

---  Steps:

# 1:  Setup and loading datasets
- Using Python, I did a setup for PySpark with VS Code and will commit my final results into GitHub repository when the project is done.
- First I'm going to load the datasets given into dataframes.

# 2: Analyze and inspect data
- With dataframes I'll analyze each dataset to see what informations I have on the columns and how they align with each other.

# 3: Clearing Data and processing
- Removing duplicates.
- Handle missing values: drop the full NULL rows.
- Remove non-readable characters;
- Clean phone numbers to ensure using them as reliable key;

# 4: Join datasets and merge data
